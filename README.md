# Autonomous Car Detection Using YOLO
This is a repository containing files associated with a project done under Winter in Data Science (WiDS) program by Analytics Club, Indian Institue of Technology, Bombay.

For this project, I had to use a pre-trained YOLO model to detect objects from the following dataset - [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)

After that, I had to train a YOLO model on a different dataset - [Dataset 2](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/vehicles-openimages/1)
